# Job Posting Analyzer (AI-Assisted)

## Overview
A command-line tool that analyzes software job postings to:
- Identify required and preferred technical skills
- Flag roles that may not be truly entry-level
- Generate resume keyword suggestions and tailored bullet ideas

This project was built using a combination of manual development and AI-assisted coding tools (Cursor and ChatGPT), with a focus on validating and testing AI-generated output.

## Features (Planned)
- Parse job descriptions from text files or pasted input
- Extract technical skills (languages, frameworks, tools)
- Detect experience requirements and entry-level mismatches
- Output a structured analysis to the terminal and/or markdown report
- Optional AI-assisted resume bullet and keyword generation

## Why This Project
This tool reflects a real workflow used by early-career engineers applying to software roles and demonstrates responsible use of generative AI in software development.

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Interface: Command-line (CLI)
- Tools: Cursor, ChatGPT
- Version Control: Git / GitHub

## AI-Assisted Development Notes
AI tools were used to:
- Generate initial code scaffolding
- Assist with prompt design
- Suggest refactoring and improvements

All AI-generated code was reviewed, modified, and validated through testing.

## Status
Project scaffolding complete. Core functionality in progress.
